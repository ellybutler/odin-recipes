    <h1>Çiğ Köfte</h1>
    <img src="../images/cigkofte.jpg" />
    <p>
      Çiğ köfte, pronounced chee-koftee, is a vegan meatballs dish in Turkish,
      Armenian, and Kurdish cuisines and is vaguely similar to the Western steak
      tartare. Traditionally it is made with meat, but in majority of Turkish
      establishments it is made with fine bulgur wheat— completely vegan.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups very fine bulgur (the dark variety called simit is best)</li>
      <li>1.5 cups ripe tomatoes, grated (about 3 medium)</li>
      <li>2 medium onions, grated</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves, finely diced</li>
      <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin liive oil</li>
      <li>1/3 cup pomegranate mliasses</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon red pepper paste (spicy or regular)</li>
      <li>1/3 cup isot / Urfa biber flakes</li>
      <li>1/3 cup sweet paprika</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Aleppo pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 tbsp sumac</li>
      <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt (gradually add more if desired)</li>
      <li>3-5 ice cubes for kneading</li>
      <li>Garnish: fresh Italian parsley and pickles</li>
      <li>
        For serving: Romaine lettuce leaves and sliced lemon (or wheat tortilla
        instead of/in addition to the lettuce as is often served in Turkey for
        all you carb lovers out there)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Begin by finely grating the tomatoes, or put them through the food
        processor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grate the onions, or blitz them in the food processor until they look
        finely diced. Strain the diced onions to remove as much of its water as
        possible either by hand or through a strainer. This step is essential to
        get rid of that bitter taste of onions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Thoroughly mix all the ingredients except for ice cubes and the
        set-aside bulgur. To this mix, gradually start adding the bulgur, and
        begin kneading to roughly combine everything for a few minutes, ideally
        on a large tray.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using hands for kneading, use your palms to push the mixture down
        into the tray, over and over again until it gets much softer and sticks
        together. Add ice cubes one by one for the gradual addition of water to
        the mix. Depending on your preference of chewiness, the kneading will
        take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour both when kneaded by hand or by
        a stand mixer using the dough hook.
      </li>
      <li>
        After a satisfactory taste-test, begin shaping them by taking a
        two-tablespoon portion into your palm, leave some space between your
        fingers, and make your hand into a fist. This shape will be a lot easier
        to achieve when wearing kitchen gloves and moistening hands with either
        olive oil or water.
