    <p>
      Think of gözleme as Turkey's response to a quesadilla. It is a no-yeast
      flatbread with fillings. Simple and delicious.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2.75 cups (400g) all-purpose flour (Note 1)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp (3g) table salt, double if using kosher</li>
      <li>1 cup + 4 teaspoon (260ml) water</li>
      <li>extra flour for shaping and rolling the dough (½ cup)</li>

      <li>
        4 cups (900g / 32 oz) frozen spinach, thawed and strained (Note 2)
      </li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 cup (200g) plant-based feta (Note 3)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Add flour, salt, and water into a large bowl and mix with a wooden spoon
        until well combined, usually takes 1-2 minutes. Hand-knead for about 10
        minutes (or 4 minutes with stand-mixer on medium-speed) until the
        texture is no longer sticky and becomes smooth.
      </li>
      <li>Cover and rest for at least half an hour for the gluten to relax.</li>
      <li>
        The relaxed dough should minimally bounce back when poked. Divide into 8
        pieces and shape them into balls using your palms. Set aside the balls
        until it's time to roll them out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Squeeze out most of the water from the thawed spinach and season with
        salt.
      </li>
      <li>Crumble up vegan feta and mix into the spinach.</li>
      <li>
        Liberally dust the work surface and rolling pin with flour and roll out
        each ball as thinly as you can. 1-2mm thickness is ideal. The original
        recipe that calls for 82g balls can be rolled into an 8-in (20-cm)
        diameter circle. The edges don't need to look perfect since they'll be
        folded in.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread filling into the middle of the dough in a square shape. Fold all
        sides over like a parcel and lightly press down the edges to seal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle flour on a cutting board or pizza paddle. Slide the gozleme
        onto the board to make transferring onto the cooking surface easier.
      </li>
      <li>
        Over medium-high heat, heat up ½ teaspoon of olive oil in a skillet. Get
        as many pans going as you have space for on the stove-top to shorten the
        cooking time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place gozleme into skillet. Cook on each side for about 3-5 minutes
        until golden and crispy on both sides. A little charring is common.
      </li>
    </ol>
